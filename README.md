# Melfa Digital Twin - Unity Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a **Digital Twin** of the **Mitsubishi MELFA RV-1A robotic arm** using **Unity**.  
It provides a 3D real-time visualization of the robotic armâ€™s movements and lays the groundwork for future interaction with the physical robot.

## Features
- Accurate 3D model of the MELFA RV-1A robotic arm.
- Basic joint manipulation and animation within Unity.
- Modular project structure designed for easy extension.
- Foundation for real-time synchronization with the physical robot.

## Requirements
- Unity Editor 2020.3 LTS or later
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2019/2022 (for editing C# scripts)
- (Optional) Mitsubishi MELFA RV-1A robotic arm for future real-time integration
